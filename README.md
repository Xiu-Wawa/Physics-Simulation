# Coupled Oscillations Simulation

This is a Python simulation of coupled oscillations using the Tkinter and Matplotlib libraries. It demonstrates the behavior of two masses connected by springs and interacting with each other.

## Description

The simulation showcases the behavior of two masses that are connected by springs, allowing you to explore the effects of different parameters such as spring constants and masses on their motion.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of coupled oscillations.
- Adjustable spring constants and masses to observe changes in motion.
- Drag-and-drop interaction to set initial positions of masses.
- Start and stop buttons to control the simulation.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Physics-Simulation.git
   cd Physics-Simulation
