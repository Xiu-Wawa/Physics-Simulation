# Coupled Oscillations Simulation

This repository contains a Python simulation of coupled oscillations using the Tkinter and Matplotlib libraries. The simulation demonstrates the behavior of two masses connected by springs and interacting with each other.

## Features

- Interactive visualization of coupled oscillations.
- Adjustable spring constants and masses to observe changes in motion.
- Drag-and-drop interaction to set initial positions of masses.
- Start and stop buttons to control the simulation.

## Getting Started

To run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Physics-Simulation.git
   cd Physics-Simulation
Install the required libraries using pip:

sh
Copy code
pip install matplotlib numpy
Run the simulation:

sh
Copy code
python simulation.py
Drag the balls to set their initial positions, then click the "Start" button to see the simulation in action.

Customization
You can customize various parameters in the simulation.py script, such as spring constants, masses, and simulation settings.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Matplotlib library
Numpy library
